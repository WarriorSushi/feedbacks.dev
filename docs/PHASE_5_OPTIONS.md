# Phase 5 – Next Steps (ELI5)

Here are strong options to keep momentum. Pick one and we’ll start.

## Recommended

- Assignments & Workflow: Add assignees, statuses (open/in progress/resolved), and internal notes.
  - ELI5: make feedbacks actionable like mini‑tickets.

## Good Alternatives

- Email Alerts + Rules: Instant alerts for low ratings or “bug” type; daily/weekly digests via email.
  - ELI5: get notified without opening the app.
- Public Portal + Changelog: A public page for collecting/voting on ideas and posting releases.
  - ELI5: a front door for users to suggest and track progress.
- Analytics++: Top pages, top tags, negative‑rating slices, “rising tags,” and per‑page trends.
  - ELI5: see where fire is hottest.
- Jira/GitHub Issues: One‑click “Create issue” and two‑way links; optional auto‑sync rules.
  - ELI5: send feedbacks to engineering’s to‑do list.
- Teams & Roles (+Billing‑ready): Invite members, roles per project, orgs; prepare for paid tiers.
  - ELI5: collaborate safely as a team and scale.
