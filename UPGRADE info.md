 - Solid MVP: a lightweight vanilla TS widget + Next.js 14 dashboard + Supabase with RLS. Clear docs and CI are in
  place. The widget looks comfortably under the 20KB budget and mobile-first CSS is thoughtful.
  - Most gaps are in polish, security/robustness edges, and product leverage. You can ship this, but a few surgical
  fixes will make it safer, smoother, and easier to grow.

  What’s Great

  - Widget: Tiny, framework-agnostic, mobile-first styles, sensible retry logic, reduced-motion support, exports
  window.FeedbacksWidget.
  - Dashboard: App Router with server-side auth checks; shadcn/ui consistency; mobile UX elements (bottom nav, safe-
  area, limited motion).
  - Backend: Clear SQL schema and RLS; rate limit present; service role used server-side only; docs are unusually
  comprehensive (README, guide, PRD, UI roadmap).
  - CI: Type-check matrix + widget size check; basic audits and cross-OS Node versions.

  High-Impact Issues (Fix First)

  - Insecure API key generation on client: generateApiKey() uses Math.random in packages/dashboard/src/lib/utils.ts.
  This is not cryptographically strong and happens client-side. Move to server-side generation or use DB default
  function generate_api_key() (you already have it in SQL) so the client never generates or sees random logic. Set
  api_key text unique not null default generate_api_key(), and remove client-side generation entirely.
  - Missing pgcrypto extension: SQL uses gen_random_bytes but never create extension if not exists pgcrypto;. Add that
  to 001_initial_schema.sql or you’ll get runtime errors on fresh Supabase.
  - CORS/auth-status mismatch: packages/dashboard/src/app/api/auth-status/route.ts sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
  https://www.feedbacks.dev, but the homepage fetches https://app.feedbacks.dev/api/auth-status with credentials:
  'include'. With credentials you cannot use *, and you must echo the exact Origin. Also, it should support both
  https://feedbacks.dev and https://www.feedbacks.dev depending on where you render. Solution: read Origin header, match
  against an allowlist, then echo it.
  - Hard-coded cross-domain fetch: src/app/page.tsx uses absolute https://app.feedbacks.dev/api/auth-status. Use
  relative /api/auth-status so deployments (local/staging/prod) don’t break and avoid needless CORS.
  - Broken version bump script path: packages/widget/version-bump.js updates ../dashboard/src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx
  but actual file is src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/page.tsx. Version bumps won’t propagate to the dashboard’s embed
  snippet.
  - Next.js config dead path: packages/dashboard/next.config.js rewrites /widget/:path* → /api/widget/:path*, but
  there’s no such API. Either implement that or remove the rewrite/headers.
  - Leaky logs in auth callback: app/auth/callback/route.ts has extensive console.log with runtime details. Gate logs by
  env or remove in production to avoid noisy logs and potential info leaks.

  Code Smells / Bloat

  - Duplicate Supabase clients: you have supabase.ts, supabase-server.ts, and supabase-client.ts, with overlapping
  createClient names. Consolidate into one clear pattern: createBrowserClient() and createServerClient() in one place;
  import with explicit names to prevent confusion.
  - Unused dependencies: ramda in root package.json isn’t used. zod is listed in dashboard but not used. Remove or start
  using (e.g., client-side schema validation).
  - Unused code: src/lib/cache.ts (nav cache) appears unused. UserMenu is imported on the homepage but not used. Trim
  for clarity.
  - Mixed widget versions: Dist has both 1.0.0 and 1.0 compatibility files (good), but keep the system coherent:
  dashboard uses 1.0, CI checks 1.0.0. Define the single source of truth (package.json) and automate both build
  artifacts via deploy script as you already do, but ensure docs and examples align consistently.
  - Overly specific headers: auth-status CORS returns only Content-Type as allowed header; future changes
  (Authorization) will break. Either echo requested headers or set a small allowlist that includes Authorization.

  Security & Privacy

  - Key generation: Move off client Math.random (see above). Prefer DB default or an RPC with service role on server
  only.
  - Rate limiting: In-memory map is per-instance and ephemeral in serverless. For production, use a centralized store
  (Upstash/Redis or Supabase table with RLS + cron cleanup) or per-IP token bucket via edge middleware.
  - CORS rigor:
      - Feedback API uses '*' for Access-Control-Allow-Origin which is correct for anonymous widget usage, but do not
  pair this with cookies. It currently doesn’t; keep it that way.
      - For authenticated routes (auth-status, sign-out), echo exact origin and include Vary: Origin.
  - Session cookies across subdomains: If you plan auth from marketing domain, ensure cookies are set with
  Domain=.feedbacks.dev and correct SameSite attributes; otherwise credentials: 'include' from www → app may fail on
  Safari. Consider keeping marketing and app on the same subdomain (or don’t show auth status on marketing page).
  - Input validation: Server validates message length, email format, URL, good. Consider adding HTML stripping/
  sanitization server-side for message and storing original and sanitized variants. Also consider basic spam heuristics
  and optional HMAC from widget later (documented in PRD).
  - Console logs: Remove noisy logs in critical auth paths.

  Reliability & Performance

  - Widget resilience: Good retry/backoff. Consider backoff jitter and an abort controller timeout to fail fast on flaky
  networks.
  - CSP compatibility: Many host sites use CSP. Offer an ES module build and document CSP requirements (style-src for
  inline styles if any, script-src for CDN). Consider an option that avoids injecting innerHTML (you already build DOM
  with innerHTML for form).
  - SRI & integrity: Publish SRI hashes for the CDN script and stylesheet to support integrity attributes in script
  tags.
  - Bundle budget: You’re in a great place (~8.3KB raw JS + ~9KB CSS — likely <20KB gz). Keep an eye on growth when
  adding features (screenshot, reactions). Adopt a performance budget in CI for both JS and CSS gzipped sizes.

  Product/UX Observations

  - Widget UX:
      - Add simple categories (Bug, Idea, Praise) and a 1–5 rating toggle (you already show ratings in dashboard mocks).
  Minimal overhead, massive triage value.
      - Allow optional screenshot capture (planned); consider a no-dependency approach via html2canvas on-demand or a
  small micro-frontend loaded only when user opens the modal.
      - A11y: Ensure focus trapping in modal (tab/shift+tab) and ARIA roles are correct. You already set dialog role;
  add explicit focus trap and return focus to trigger on close.
      - Success/error states are solid; add a non-modal inline error variant for sites with strict modals.
  - Dashboard UX:
      - Real data vs mock: Dashboard uses mock feedback in multiple pages. Prioritize wiring live Supabase queries
  everywhere with pagination over 20 items.
      - Mobile: Good bottom nav. Consider sticky actions on item cards and consistent spacing rhythm to reduce cognitive
  load.
      - Empty states: Already present; add shortcuts (e.g., “Install widget” CTA on empty feedback).
      - Loading skeletons: You have skeleton components; ensure all server transitions show skeletons consistently.
  - Marketing page:
      - The fixed frosted header is nice; ensure it doesn’t cause cumulative layout shift (CLS). You already offset with
  pt-16, good.
      - Avoid cross-domain auth checks on landing as discussed; it’s brittle and not a strong signal for conversions.

  DX & CI

  - Testing: No tests present yet. Add Playwright smoke tests for:
      - Auth flows (email magic link stub or GitHub mock)
      - Create project → see API key → embed snippet renders
      - Widget POST flow (mock Supabase with test table)
      - Mobile viewport smoke (navigation, keyboard, focus)
  - Linting: Next’s lint is optional. Add ESLint + simple rules and run in CI.
  - CI widget size check: Switch to gzipped size checks (JS+CSS), not raw bytes, and fail on regressions > X%.
  - Release hygiene:
      - Fix version-bump.js path.
      - Automate dashboard embed snippet via templates driven by package.json version in a single place.

  Architecture Improvements

  - Supabase client consolidation:
      - One lib/supabase.ts with export const createBrowserClient and createServerClient.
      - Avoid duplicate createClient() names to eliminate confusion.
  - Auth across domains:
      - If multi-domain is intentional, add a tiny service to read session via token or just skip landing auth check
  entirely. Simpler: unify to single app domain and keep marketing static.
  - Rate limiting at edge:
      - Next Middleware + edge KV to enforce 10/min per IP, per region. Reduces cold-start variation and instance-local
  memory state.

  Polish Roadmap (2–4 weeks)

  - Security: DB-side API key generation; pgcrypto extension; tighten CORS.
  - DX: Tests, lint, fix version bump path; remove unused deps; unify supabase clients.
  - UX: Focus trap, categories/ratings, consistent skeletons; real data wired; export CSV in feedback page; quick
  filters (Bug/Idea/Praise).
  - Docs: Add SRI hashes, CSP notes, public roadmap link; improve migration steps with pgcrypto.

  New Ideas With High Leverage

  - Instant webhooks: Slack/Discord and generic webhooks per project (JSON payloads). Cheap to implement; huge perceived
  value.
  - One-click GitHub/Linear issue creation from feedback. Store external issue IDs; bi-directional status updates later.
  - AI assist (lightweight): Summarize feedback threads per project, cluster duplicates, sentiment by tag. Start as an
  async job with cached summaries; don’t overbuild.
  - Public feedback board: Optional project setting to show a simple upvotable list of ideas (privacy-respecting).
  Drives virality with minimal dev.
  - NPM wrappers: Tiny wrappers for React/Vue/Svelte export the same widget with framework sugar. Very low maintenance,
  improves adoption.
  - CMS/ecom starters: Snippets for WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Framer. Low effort docs, high reach.
  - Chrome extension: Let teams capture page+comment and send to the same endpoint with API key; light UI, big utility
  for internal QA.

  Potential Use Cases

  - Customer-facing sites: Bug reporting with URL, device capture.
  - Internal QA: Staging deployments with inline feedback.
  - Docs portals: Gather missing content suggestions.
  - Agency clients: Embed on client sites + white-label (planned); agencies love simple shared inboxes.
  - Mobile apps: Use a WebView wrapper + REST; minimal effort to unlock new platforms.

  Where to Be Ruthless

  - Remove unused libs (ramda, zod if not used, nav cache).
  - Strip verbose console logs in production paths.
  - Kill dead rewrites/headers in Next config.
  - Replace all mock data with real queries + server-side pagination ASAP.

  Make It World-Class

  - Security by default: server-only key gen, edge rate limiting, airtight CORS.
  - Dependable DX: tests, lint, automated releases, bundle budgets, SRI.
  - Delightful UX: A11y-compliant modal, categories/ratings, stellar empty states, fast skeletons, frictionless embed
  with copy buttons and verified CDN integrity.
  - Tight docs: framework recipes, CSP instructions, SRI hashes, clear migration scripts (including pgcrypto).
